Corrected Reflectance Frontend
==============================

The Corrected Reflectance (crefl) Frontend operates on corrected reflectance
files created from VIIRS Science Data Record (SDR) files or MODIS Level 1B
(L1B) files.

Corrected reflectance files are created by third party software developed by
NASA. The ``CREFL_SPA`` algorithm for MODIS and ``CVIIRS_SPA`` algorithm
for VIIRS can be found here:
