polar2grid
======================================

polar2grid provides scripts, utilities, and library functions for converting,
or remapping, polar-orbiting satellite data to a known map grid.  All
polar2grid remapping scripts execute a series of function calls known as
"The Chain".  These functions being called act as a toolbox for software
developers to make their own scripts.  See :doc:`Advanced Topics <advanced>`
for more details if the basic documentation doesn't answer your questions.
