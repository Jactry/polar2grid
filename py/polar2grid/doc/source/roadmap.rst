Roadmap
=======

Below are some key features that were/will be added for the version
specified.  If a feature was not added, but was originally listed
it is in italics.  If a feature was added, but was originally listed
for another version it will have a '(from version x.x.x)' at the end
of the feature description.  This suffix will also occur if the feature was
implemented in a minor, yet released, version of polar2grid.

.. To documenters: Use a '*' on both sides of a phrase to make it italics.
