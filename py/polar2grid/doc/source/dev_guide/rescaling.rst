Rescaling
=========

Rescaling is a component that takes grids of data and scales them to a proper
range, usable by a product backend.  Rescaling should only be called by
backends.  Although it is possible, there shouldn't be any need to subclass
the default :py:class:`Rescaler <polar2grid.core.rescale.Rescaler>` in
:py:mod:`polar2grid.core.rescale`.
