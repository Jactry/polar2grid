Python Package Install
----------------------

If you would like more control over your python/polar2grid environment
you can install the polar2grid python package like any basic python egg:

    ``easy_install -f http://larch.ssec.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/repos.cgi polar2grid``

Installing polar2grid in this way does require, however, that the ms2gt
utilities ``ll2cr`` and ``fornav`` must be in your $PATH environment
variable.  The polar2grid python package also has the following prerequisite
packages:

    - numpy
    - h5py
    - netCDF4
    - matplotlib
