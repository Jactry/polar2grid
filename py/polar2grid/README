Installation
============
polar2grid should be used as an internal package to the polar2grid software
bundle.  The software bundle includes C, IDL, and Python packages/libraries
to properly go from VIIRS data to AWIPS-compatible NC files.  polar2grid is
tested using the ShellB3 python environment, which includes the necessary
python packages.  ShellB3 is part of the polar2grid software bundle.

The polar2grid python package can be installed like any normal python egg:
    "easy_install polar2grid"
    "python setup.py install"
    "untar polar2grid-<version>.tar.gz; export PYTHONPATH=polar2grid/:$PYTONPATH"

Use Notes
=========
It requires that the ms2gt utilties 'll2cr' and 'fornav' be in the PATH
environment variable.

See the sphinx documentation for how-tos and other usage notes.
